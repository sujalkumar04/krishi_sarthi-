Maize (Zea mays L.): A Comprehensive Global Analysis of its Biology, Cultivation, and Socio-Economic Impact




Executive Summary


Maize (Zea mays L.), a cereal grain first domesticated in Mesoamerica thousands of years ago, has evolved into a cornerstone of the global food system. Its remarkable genetic plasticity and high productivity have enabled its cultivation across a vast range of agro-ecological zones, making it the most produced cereal by volume worldwide. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of maize, synthesizing information on its botanical origins, global economic importance, agronomic principles, and future prospects to serve as a definitive resource for farmers, researchers, policymakers, and students.
The journey of maize from its wild ancestor, teosinte, is a testament to one of humanity's greatest agronomic achievements, a process now understood to involve a pivotal hybridization event that unlocked its adaptive potential. This inherent genetic diversity is reflected in its complex genome and the vast array of landraces and hybrids that exist today. Globally, maize is a multi-purpose commodity, with its primary use being animal feed, which underpins the world's meat and dairy industries. It is also a critical staple food for hundreds of millions in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and a key feedstock for industrial products, most notably biofuels. This versatility, however, creates complex interdependencies, where policies affecting energy or feed markets can have direct consequences on food security for the world's most vulnerable populations.
The global maize market is characterized by a high concentration of production and exports in a few key nations, primarily the United States, China, Brazil, and Argentina. This concentration creates systemic risks, making global prices and supply chains highly susceptible to regional climatic or geopolitical shocks. For farmers, successful cultivation hinges on a deep understanding of the crop's ecological requirements, integrated nutrient and water management, and effective control of a wide spectrum of pests, diseases, and weeds. In India, maize is the third most important cereal, with distinct production systems across its Kharif, Rabi, and summer seasons, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for its 15 million maize growers.
Looking ahead, the maize sector stands at a technological crossroads. The challenges of climate change, resource scarcity, and a growing global population demand innovations that enhance productivity and sustainability. The convergence of advanced breeding technologies, including genome editing with CRISPR-Cas, and the rise of precision agriculture powered by drones, sensors, and artificial intelligence, offers a transformative pathway. These tools promise to accelerate the development of climate-resilient, high-yield varieties and enable hyper-efficient, data-driven farming systems.
This report concludes with targeted recommendations. For farmers, it emphasizes the adoption of integrated management practices and high-yielding, adapted hybrids. For researchers, it highlights the need to explore the maize pangenome, validate new technologies in diverse field conditions, and develop holistic, climate-smart systems. For policymakers, it underscores the importance of investing in infrastructure, supporting research and development, and creating coherent policies that balance the competing demands for food, feed, and fuel, thereby ensuring a sustainable and secure future for this vital global crop.


Section 1: The Genesis and Global Journey of a Staple Crop


The story of maize is inextricably linked with the story of human civilization in the Americas and, subsequently, the world. Its transformation from a wild grass into a high-yielding global staple is a profound example of human-plant co-evolution. Understanding its origins, botanical identity, and physiological characteristics is fundamental to appreciating its current role and future potential.


From Teosinte to Global Dominance: The Story of Domestication


The scientific consensus, supported by extensive genetic and archaeological evidence, places the origin of maize in the Balsas River Valley of southern Mexico.1 The term "maize," used globally outside of North America where "corn" is common, is derived from the word "mahiz" from the indigenous Taino language of the Caribbean.2
The wild ancestor of maize is a grass known as teosinte. Genetic analyses have pinpointed Zea mays ssp. parviglumis as the direct progenitor, with the initial process of domestication beginning approximately 9,000 to 10,000 years ago.3 This process was not a single, linear event but a more complex, multi-stage innovation. While the initial selection by ancient Mesoamerican farmers began around 10,000 years ago, recent genomic studies have revealed a second, pivotal event that occurred about 5,000 years ago: a hybridization between the partially domesticated lowland maize and a highland teosinte subspecies,
Zea mays ssp. mexicana.6 This introgression contributed roughly 20% of the genome of modern maize and is strongly correlated with archaeological evidence showing a surge in maize's importance as a staple food around the same period.6 This hybridization event was likely the catalyst for maize's rapid expansion, as it introduced crucial genes related to larger cob size and, critically, adaptations in flowering time that allowed the tropical crop to be cultivated in the longer day-lengths of temperate latitudes.6 This suggests that ancient farmers were not merely selecting for favorable traits but were sophisticated innovators who recognized and capitalized on the benefits of hybridization, a foundational principle of modern maize breeding.
This human-driven evolution transformed the plant's morphology. Teosinte is a short, highly branched, bushy plant with tiny ears bearing a few kernels, each encased in a hard fruitcase. Through generations of selective breeding, farmers favored mutations that led to the modern maize phenotype: a single, tall stalk, a large ear (cob) with hundreds of exposed ("naked") kernels, and a non-shattering rachis that keeps the kernels attached to the cob for easy harvesting.2 This dramatic transformation was controlled by a relatively small number of key genes. For example, mutations in the
teosinte branched-1 (tb1) gene suppressed branching to create a single main stalk, while changes in the teosinte glume architecture 1 (tga1) gene were responsible for the transition from hard-encased seeds to the exposed kernels of modern maize.4
Maize became the dietary and cultural centerpiece of great Mesoamerican civilizations, including the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec.2 Its importance is woven into their cosmology, as seen in the Mayan creation story, the Popol Vuh, where the first humans were fashioned from maize dough.2 A critical technological innovation from this era was nixtamalization, the process of steeping and cooking maize in an alkaline solution (such as water with wood ash or slaked lime). This process makes the grain easier to grind, but more importantly, it unlocks key nutrients, increasing the bioavailability of vitamin B3 (niacin) and reducing mycotoxins, thereby preventing the nutritional deficiency disease pellagra.2
After its introduction to Europe in the late 15th century, maize spread rapidly across the globe.4 Genetic studies trace the divergence of modern maize into two primary divisions—temperate and tropical—to about 3,000 years ago. This split occurred as maize adapted to different latitudes, with temperate varieties spreading north across North America and tropical types moving south through the Caribbean and into South America. These two groups remain distinct today, largely due to differences in photosensitivity (response to daylength) and disease resistance.7


Botanical Classification and Genetic Diversity


Maize is formally classified as Zea mays L. within the plant kingdom. Its taxonomic hierarchy is as follows:
* Kingdom: Plantae
* Order: Poales
* Family: Poaceae (Grass Family)
* Subfamily: Panicoideae
* Genus: Zea
* Species: Z. mays 5
It is a monocotyledonous plant and belongs to the PACMAD clade of grasses, making it more closely related to sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) than to other major cereals like wheat and rice, which are in the BOP clade.5
The maize genome is notable for its exceptional level of polymorphism and structural diversity. Unlike many other species with highly conserved genomes, different inbred lines of maize can possess significantly different genetic content. This includes large-scale copy-number variations (CNVs) and presence-absence variations (PAVs), where entire genes or gene clusters are present in one line but absent in another.9 This phenomenon has led to the concept of a maize "pangenome," where the genetic information of any single line represents only a fraction of the total genetic diversity available within the species. Research on hundreds of inbred lines revealed that a significant portion of the expressed genes—the transcriptome—is "dispensable," meaning it is not shared across all varieties.9
This immense genomic fluidity is both a primary strength and a significant challenge. It is the raw material that has allowed maize to adapt to an incredible range of environments, from sea level to altitudes of 4,000 meters, and it is the genetic basis for the powerful phenomenon of hybrid vigor (heterosis) exploited in modern breeding.10 However, this same diversity means that a single reference genome is insufficient for comprehensive breeding efforts. Researchers and breeders must adopt a pangenomic approach, analyzing a wide array of genetically diverse lines to identify and utilize the full spectrum of genes controlling important traits. This makes genomic-assisted breeding in maize a more data-intensive and complex endeavor compared to species with more stable genomes.
This diversity is physically manifested in thousands of locally adapted landraces that have evolved over centuries of cultivation, representing a critical reservoir of valuable genes for traits like disease resistance and stress tolerance.2 The development of modern F1 hybrids, created by crossing two distinct and genetically uniform inbred lines, has become the standard in commercial maize production. This practice, which began in the early 20th century, leverages hybrid vigor to produce offspring that are significantly more robust and higher-yielding than either parent.5


Morphology and Physiology: The Biological Engine of a High-Yield Cereal


Maize is a tall, robust annual grass characterized by a single, solid main stalk (culm) that is unbranched except for the structures that bear the ears.13
* Root System: The plant develops a fibrous root system consisting of three types of roots. Upon germination, a temporary primary (radicle) and seminal root system anchors the seedling and absorbs initial water and nutrients. This is soon replaced by a permanent, more extensive nodal root system that grows from the lower nodes of the stem. In addition, thick brace or prop roots emerge from nodes above the soil surface, providing crucial support to prevent the tall stalk from lodging (bending or breaking).13 The majority of water and nutrient absorption occurs in the top meter of soil, where the root system is most dense.14
* Reproductive Biology: A key morphological feature of maize is that it is monoecious, meaning it has separate male and female flowers on the same plant.13 The male inflorescence, the tassel, is located at the apex of the stalk and produces a vast amount of pollen. The female inflorescences, the ears, are located in the axils of the leaves, midway up the stalk. Each potential kernel (ovule) on an ear produces a long, silky filament (the stigma), and all the silks from an ear emerge from the tip of the husk. For a kernel to develop, a pollen grain from a tassel must land on its corresponding silk and successfully fertilize the ovule.8
This spatial separation of male and female flowers is an evolutionary masterstroke that strongly promotes cross-pollination, thereby maintaining genetic diversity. This same feature was ingeniously exploited by human breeders. The process of detasseling—manually removing the tassels from rows of "female" parent plants—prevents self-pollination and ensures that their ears are fertilized only by pollen from adjacent rows of "male" parent plants. This simple, scalable technique became the cornerstone of the commercial hybrid seed industry, allowing for the mass production of high-yielding F1 hybrid seed and revolutionizing agricultural productivity.12
* Physiology: Maize possesses a C4 photosynthetic pathway, a highly efficient physiological adaptation for fixing carbon, especially in conditions of high temperature and light intensity.10 Compared to C3 plants like wheat and rice, the C4 pathway minimizes the wasteful process of photorespiration, allowing maize to convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into biomass at a very high rate. This physiological efficiency is a primary reason why maize is one of the world's most productive grain crops. In terms of water use, maize is considered efficient, requiring between 500 and 800 mm of water over its growing season to achieve maximum production.14 The crop is most vulnerable to water stress during the critical flowering period; severe drought during tasseling and silking can prevent pollination and lead to catastrophic yield losses.14


Section 2: The Global Maize Economy and its Role in Food Security


Maize has transcended its agricultural origins to become a global commodity that is central to the world's economic stability and food security. Its production volume, trade flows, and diverse end-uses create a complex global market with far-reaching implications for farmers, industries, and consumers.


Global Production and Trade Dynamics: An Analysis of Key Markets


Maize is the most produced cereal crop globally by tonnage, with annual production consistently exceeding 1.1 billion metric tons.6 In 2020, the global harvested area reached 202 million hectares, making it the second most widely grown crop after wheat.10 This massive scale of production is a relatively recent phenomenon, driven by a near-tripling of average global yields since the 1960s, from approximately 2 tons per hectare to nearly 5.8 tons per hectare, a testament to advances in breeding and agronomy.10
However, this production is highly concentrated geographically. A few countries dominate the global supply, creating a system of concentrated influence and risk. The United States is the undisputed leader, accounting for roughly 31% of the world's production. It is followed by China (24%) and Brazil (11%), with these three nations alone responsible for over two-thirds of the total global output.5 This concentration extends to the export market, where the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Ukraine are the primary suppliers to the rest of the world.16 The main net importers are nations and regions with large feed demands or significant populations, including China, the European Union, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea.16
This market structure makes global maize prices and, by extension, food security in import-dependent nations, acutely vulnerable to localized events in major producing regions. Statistical and machine-learning models have confirmed that production variations in Northern America have a disproportionately large influence on the global benchmark price (FOB US Gulf).22 A relatively small yield decrease in the US can trigger a significant spike in global prices. History has shown that such price volatility, often exacerbated by extreme weather events like droughts in key exporting countries, can contribute to broader food price inflation and social instability in nations that rely heavily on maize imports.22 Therefore, a major drought in the US Midwest or a geopolitical conflict impacting Black Sea exports represents not just a regional agricultural crisis, but a direct threat to global food market stability. This underscores a systemic vulnerability that requires strategic mitigation by importing countries, such as diversifying import sources, increasing domestic production where feasible, and maintaining strategic grain reserves.

The Four Pillars of Use: Food, Feed, Fuel, and Industrial Applications


The immense global production of maize is channeled into four primary end-uses, with utilization patterns varying dramatically by region.
1. Animal Feed: The single largest use of maize globally is for animal feed, consuming approximately 59-61% of the total supply.10 Maize is the primary energy ingredient in feed rations for poultry, swine, and cattle. The rapid growth of the global livestock sector, driven by rising incomes and demand for animal protein in developing countries, is the main engine behind the increasing demand for feed maize.24 Yellow maize is the preferred type for animal feed.16
2. Human Food: Direct human consumption accounts for a much smaller share of global use, at around 13%.10 However, this global average belies its critical importance as a staple food in many parts of the world. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, maize provides over 30% of the total calories consumed.10 Similarly, it is a dietary cornerstone in many countries in Latin America. White maize is typically preferred for human food products like maize meal and tortillas.16
3. Biofuel: A significant and growing portion of the maize crop, particularly in the United States, is diverted to produce bioethanol. Industrial uses account for roughly 19% of global maize consumption, with ethanol being the largest component.10 In the U.S., nearly 45% of the domestic corn crop is used for ethanol production, a direct result of government policies and mandates aimed at enhancing energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.18
4. Other Industrial Products: Beyond fuel, maize is a versatile industrial feedstock. Wet and dry milling processes separate the kernel into its components, which are then used to manufacture a vast array of products, including starch, sweeteners (e.g., high-fructose corn syrup), corn oil, alcoholic beverages, biodegradable plastics, and various chemical inputs.18
The crop's versatility creates a direct competition for its use, most notably captured in the "food vs. fuel" debate. Because the United States is both the world's largest producer and a dominant force in the export market, its domestic policies on biofuels have global ramifications. The large-scale diversion of the U.S. corn crop to ethanol production adds a significant source of demand to the global balance sheet. This increased demand has been shown to be a major driver of higher and more volatile global maize prices, directly linking energy policy in one country to food affordability and security in others that depend on maize as a staple food.22


Maize as a Cornerstone of Global Food and Nutritional Security


Maize contributes to global food security through multiple pathways, both direct and indirect. Its role is multifaceted, encompassing direct nutrition, support for the broader food system, and economic empowerment for rural communities.
* Direct Contribution: For hundreds of millions of people, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, maize is not just a crop but the primary source of daily sustenance. It provides essential calories and a significant portion of protein intake, forming the basis of traditional diets in forms like ugali in Kenya, tortillas in Mexico, and maize meal porridge across Southern Africa.10
* Indirect Contribution: By serving as the world's principal feed grain, maize is the foundation of the modern livestock and poultry industries. It is the energy source that enables the efficient production of meat, milk, and eggs, thereby underpinning the global supply of animal protein.24
* Economic Pillar and Livelihoods: Maize cultivation is a vital economic activity for an estimated 300 million households in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, providing income and employment along its entire value chain, from input suppliers to traders and processors.10
Despite its importance, this reliance on maize also creates significant vulnerabilities. The "maize economy" in many developing regions, while a critical source of livelihood, can also function as a poverty trap. Smallholder farmers, who constitute the majority of producers in these regions, are often dependent on a single annual harvest from rainfed systems. This makes them extremely vulnerable to climate shocks like drought, which can wipe out both their food supply and their primary source of income in a single season.10 Furthermore, large yield gaps persist, meaning these farmers are often achieving only a fraction of the crop's genetic yield potential due to limited access to improved seeds, fertilizers, and knowledge of best management practices.27 Therefore, while increasing maize productivity is essential, a broader strategy focused on agricultural diversification, building resilience through climate-smart practices, and improving market access is necessary to transform maize from a source of subsistence to a driver of sustainable rural development.
Nutritionally, while maize is an excellent source of energy, traditional varieties are deficient in essential amino acids like lysine and tryptophan, and micronutrients like provitamin A. This has led to significant global research efforts in biofortification, resulting in the development of Quality Protein Maize (QPM) and provitamin A-enriched varieties to combat malnutrition in populations that rely heavily on maize.2


Section 3: Agronomic Principles for Optimal Maize Production


Achieving the high yield potential of modern maize hybrids requires a sophisticated understanding of the crop's biological needs and the implementation of precise agronomic practices. This section details the essential requirements for cultivation, from selecting the right environment to managing nutrients and water, and concludes with best practices for field operations from sowing to harvest.


Ecological Requirements: Climate, Soil, and Water


Maize is a highly adaptable crop, but its productivity is maximized within specific environmental parameters.
* Climate and Temperature: Originating as a tropical plant, maize is a warm-weather crop susceptible to frost at all growth stages.28 It is cultivated from latitudes 48°N to 40°S and at elevations from sea level to 4,000 meters.10 The minimum temperature for germination is 10°C, with optimal germination occurring above 15°C.10 Optimal average temperatures for the entire growing season range between 18°C and 23°C.29 While the plant can survive brief exposure to temperatures as high as 44°C, growth slows above 35°C, and temperatures exceeding 32°C during pollination can damage pollen and reduce kernel set, especially under low humidity.15
* Soil Requirements: Maize thrives in loose, deep, fertile, and well-drained soils, such as sandy clay loams, that allow for proper aeration and root development while retaining adequate moisture.30 It is intolerant of waterlogging, which deprives the root zone of oxygen and can lead to severe yield losses, particularly during the critical flowering stage where losses can exceed 50%.14 The optimal soil pH range is between 5.8 and 6.8. Highly acidic soils (pH below 5.5) can significantly reduce nutrient availability and may reduce yields by over 30%.30
* Water Requirements: Maize is an efficient water user in terms of dry matter production, but it requires substantial moisture to support its large biomass and high yield potential.14 A full crop cycle requires between 500 and 800 mm of water, depending on the climate and variety.14 The crop's water needs vary significantly with its growth stage. Water demand peaks during the flowering period (tasseling and silking), a stage at which water stress is most detrimental to final yield.14 Severe water deficits during this critical reproductive window can lead to poor pollination, silk drying, and a drastic reduction in the number of kernels per cob, potentially resulting in little to no grain yield.14 The relationship between evapotranspiration deficit and yield loss is quantified by the yield response factor (
Ky​), which is highest (e.g., 1.25) during the flowering and yield formation stages, indicating high sensitivity to water stress.14
* Photoperiod Sensitivity: As a plant domesticated in the tropics, maize is ancestrally a short-day plant, meaning it flowers more quickly when day lengths are shorter.38 This sensitivity posed a major barrier to its northward expansion into temperate regions with long summer days, where tropical varieties would continue to grow vegetatively without setting seed.40 The adaptation to temperate climates required a reduction in this photoperiod sensitivity, a trait controlled by key genes such as
ZmCCT.38 A transposable element insertion in the promoter of this gene was a critical post-domestication event that reduced its expression, rendering maize less sensitive to long days and enabling its successful cultivation at higher latitudes.38


Integrated Nutrient Management: From Macronutrients to Micronutrients


Maize is a heavy feeder, requiring substantial nutrient inputs to achieve high yields. A balanced and timely supply of both macronutrients and micronutrients is essential.
   * Macronutrient Requirements (NPK):
   * Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen is the most critical nutrient for maize, directly influencing vegetative growth, chlorophyll content, and ultimately, grain protein and yield.31 A high-yielding crop can require up to 200 kg/ha of N.14 Nitrogen is mobile within the plant, so deficiency symptoms first appear on the older, lower leaves. The classic symptom is a V-shaped yellowing that starts at the tip of the leaf and progresses down the midrib.41
   * Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus is vital for early root development, energy transfer (ATP), and reproductive growth.31 Deficiency is common in cool, wet soils and appears on young plants. Symptoms include stunted growth and a characteristic reddish-purple discoloration on the leaf tips and margins, starting with the older leaves.41
   * Potassium (K): Potassium is required in the largest quantity by maize and is crucial for water regulation, stalk strength, and the transport of sugars from the leaves to the grain.31 Deficiency symptoms appear first on the lower leaves, with yellowing and necrosis (browning) along the leaf margins, starting at the tip.41 Severe deficiency can lead to weak stalks and late-season lodging.42

	   * Micronutrient Management: While needed in smaller quantities, micronutrients like Zinc (Zn), Boron (B), and Manganese (Mn) are critical. Zinc deficiency is one of the most common micronutrient problems in maize, favored by high pH and low organic matter soils. It causes a characteristic white band to appear on the leaves.42 Micronutrients can be applied to the soil, as a foliar spray for rapid correction, or as a seed treatment.47
   * Integrated Nutrient Management (INM): INM is a sustainable approach that combines the use of organic manures (like Farmyard Manure - FYM or vermicompost), inorganic chemical fertilizers, and biofertilizers (Azospirillum, Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria).49 This strategy aims to optimize nutrient supply, maintain long-term soil fertility, and improve nutrient use efficiency. In India, recommendations often include a basal application of FYM (e.g., 10-12.5 t/ha) along with the full dose of P and K and a portion of N at sowing, with the remaining N applied in splits during the vegetative growth phase to match crop demand.51


Cultivation Practices: From Seed Selection to Post-Harvest Management


A successful maize crop depends on a series of well-executed field operations.
   * Land Preparation: The goal is to create a fine, loose, and well-aerated seedbed to ensure good seed-to-soil contact and facilitate germination and root growth.30 This typically involves primary tillage (plowing) followed by secondary tillage (harrowing). In rainfed or high-rainfall areas, sowing on ridges or beds is recommended to improve drainage and prevent waterlogging.54 Conservation tillage systems like no-till and strip-till are also increasingly used to reduce soil erosion, conserve moisture, and cut costs.30
   * Seed Selection and Treatment: The choice of variety is paramount and should be based on adaptability to the local agro-climate, maturity duration, yield potential, and resistance to prevalent pests and diseases.57 Using certified, high-quality seed is crucial for ensuring genetic purity and good germination.59 Seed treatment with fungicides and insecticides is a standard practice to protect seedlings from soil-borne diseases and early-season insect pests like shoot fly.54
   * Sowing Methods:
   * Dibbling/Precision Drilling: This is the preferred method as it ensures uniform plant spacing, consistent depth, and optimal plant population, which are critical for minimizing competition and maximizing yield.55 Seeds are typically sown at a depth of 4-7 cm.61
   * Ridge and Furrow/Bed Planting: Ideal for managing water, especially in irrigated or high-rainfall areas. Seeds are dibbled on the side of the ridges.55 This method also facilitates furrow irrigation.
   * Broadcasting: This method involves scattering seeds across the field. It is less efficient, leading to uneven plant stands and making subsequent operations like weeding more difficult, though some studies show it can produce higher forage yields due to denser plant populations.55
   * Intercultural Operations:
   * Thinning: If more than one seed is sown per hill, thinning to a single healthy seedling is done 12-15 days after sowing to maintain the desired plant population.52
   * Weed Management: Weeds are a major constraint, competing for nutrients, water, and light, and can cause significant yield loss. The critical period for weed competition is the first 15-45 days after sowing.54 Management involves an integrated approach combining mechanical methods (hoeing), cultural practices (intercropping with legumes like cowpea), and chemical control (pre- and post-emergence herbicides like Atrazine).54
   * Earthing Up: This involves mounding soil around the base of the plants, typically during inter-cultivation. It helps provide support to the stalk, prevent lodging, and can help manage weeds in the plant row.
   * Harvesting and Post-Harvest Management:
   * Harvesting: Maize is harvested when the kernels reach physiological maturity, indicated by the formation of a "black layer" at the base of the kernel and a grain moisture content of around 30-35%.65 Harvesting can be done manually or mechanically. Delayed harvesting increases the risk of losses from lodging, pests, and grain discoloration.66
   * Drying: Harvested grain typically has a moisture content of 18-24%, which is too high for safe storage.67 It must be dried to a safe moisture level of around 12-14% to prevent the growth of molds and fungi, which can produce harmful mycotoxins like aflatoxin.66 Drying can be done naturally in the sun or using mechanical dryers (batch or continuous flow).67
   * Shelling, Cleaning, and Storage: After drying, the kernels are shelled from the cob. The grain is then cleaned to remove foreign material and stored in clean, dry, and well-aerated structures. Using hermetic storage bags or placing bags on pallets can protect the grain from moisture, insects, and rodents.66


Section 4: Addressing Production Challenges: Stress, Pests, and Diseases


Despite its high yield potential, maize production is constrained by a range of environmental (abiotic) and biological (biotic) stresses. Building resilience to these challenges through genetic improvement and integrated management is crucial for stabilizing and enhancing global yields.


Building Resilience: Understanding and Managing Abiotic Stresses


Abiotic stresses are non-living environmental factors that negatively impact crop growth and productivity. Maize is particularly sensitive to several of these stresses, especially at critical growth stages.
   * Drought Stress: Drought is considered the most damaging abiotic stress for maize worldwide, as the crop is more sensitive to water deficiency than many other cereals.69 Yield losses can range from 39% to 100% depending on the timing and severity of the stress.69 Drought affects all stages of development, from hindering germination and seedling establishment to reducing photosynthetic area and impairing root growth.15 The most critical period is flowering; water stress at this time can cause asynchrony between pollen shed and silk emergence, leading to poor pollination and severe yield reduction.14 Plants respond to drought through mechanisms like stomatal closure (mediated by the hormone abscisic acid - ABA), osmotic adjustment (accumulating solutes like proline to maintain cell turgor), and developing deeper root systems.69
   * Heat Stress: High temperatures, often occurring concurrently with drought, can significantly reduce maize yields.70 Temperatures above 32-35°C can damage pollen, reduce photosynthesis, and shorten the grain-filling period.15 Maize plants cope with heat stress by producing heat shock proteins (HSPs), which protect cellular structures and enzymes from denaturation, and by altering membrane lipid composition to maintain stability.70
   * Salinity Stress: Maize is moderately sensitive to soil salinity, which is a growing problem in irrigated and arid regions.72 Salinity imposes a dual stress: an osmotic stress that reduces water uptake by roots (physiological drought) and an ionic stress caused by the toxic accumulation of ions like sodium (
Na+) and chloride (Cl−) in plant tissues.74 These stresses inhibit growth, reduce photosynthetic pigments, and disrupt nutrient balance.76 Tolerance mechanisms include the exclusion of toxic ions from the shoot, sequestration of ions into vacuoles, and the production of osmolytes to maintain cellular water balance.74
   * Flooding and Waterlogging: Excess soil water leads to anaerobic (low oxygen) conditions in the root zone, which inhibits root respiration and function. Maize is highly susceptible to waterlogging, especially in the early vegetative stages (before V6), where it can tolerate only 4-5 days of excessive water before significant stand loss occurs.79 While more tolerant between V6 and V10, waterlogging during later vegetative stages can still significantly reduce nutrient uptake and yield.79 Morphological adaptations to waterlogging include the formation of aerenchyma (air channels in the root cortex) to facilitate oxygen transport from the shoot to the roots.80
   * Frost and Cold Stress: As a tropical-origin crop, maize is sensitive to cold temperatures. Growth slows below 10°C and can cease around 6°C.82 A light frost (air temperatures of 0-2°C) can kill exposed leaf tissue, with the impact on yield depending on the growth stage at which it occurs.65 A hard freeze (below -2°C for several hours) can kill the entire plant, including the stalk, leading to a complete cessation of grain filling.65 The growing point of young seedlings remains below the soil surface until the V6 stage, offering some protection from early-season frosts.29 Management of frost-damaged corn depends on the growth stage and severity of damage and may include harvesting for silage, grazing, or incorporation into the soil.86


Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM)


A wide array of insect pests and diseases attack maize from seedling to storage, necessitating an integrated management approach that combines cultural, biological, and chemical control methods.
      * Major Insect Pests in India:
      * Stem Borers: The spotted stem borer (Chilo partellus) is a major pest during the Kharif season, while the pink stem borer (Sesamia inferens) is more prevalent in Rabi. Larvae bore into the whorl and stem, causing "shot hole" symptoms on leaves and "dead hearts" in young plants, leading to significant yield losses of 26-80%.88
      * Fall Armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda): An invasive pest that has become a major threat in India. Larvae cause extensive damage by feeding on leaves, whorls, and ears at all stages of crop growth, leading to severe defoliation and yield loss.88
      * Corn Earworm (Helicoverpa armigera): Larvae feed directly on developing kernels in the ear, reducing both yield and grain quality.88
      * Shoot Fly (Atherigona spp.): A serious pest of spring-sown maize, where maggots bore into the central shoot of seedlings, causing dead hearts.89
      * Storage Pests: Maize weevils (Sitophilus zeamais) and the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica) are major pests of stored grain, causing significant post-harvest losses.91
      * Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for FAW: IPM for Fall Armyworm involves a multi-pronged strategy:
      * Cultural: Deep ploughing to expose pupae, timely and uniform sowing, intercropping with pulses, and erection of bird perches.90
      * Mechanical: Hand-picking and destruction of egg masses and larvae, and mass trapping of male moths using pheromone traps.92
      * Biological: Augmentative release of egg parasitoids like Trichogramma pretiosum and application of biopesticides like Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and Metarhizium anisopliae.90
      * Chemical: Need-based application of recommended insecticides like Emamectin benzoate or Spinetoram, directed into the whorl.90
      * Major Diseases in India:
      * Turcicum Leaf Blight (TLB) (Exserohilum turcicum): A major foliar disease, especially in humid regions, characterized by long, elliptical, grayish-tan lesions on the leaves, which can lead to complete defoliation.94
      * Maydis Leaf Blight (Bipolaris maydis): Another significant foliar disease causing small, tan lesions.94
      * Stalk Rots (Bacterial, Pythium, Fusarium, Charcoal): A complex of diseases that cause rotting of the stalk, leading to premature plant death and severe lodging. They are among the most destructive diseases, capable of causing 100% yield loss in susceptible varieties.94
      * Downy Mildews (Sorghum, Brown Stripe): These diseases cause systemic infection, leading to stunting, chlorotic stripes on leaves, and malformation of reproductive parts ("crazy top").94
      * Integrated Disease Management (IDM):
      * Host Resistance: The most effective and economical approach is the use of resistant hybrids.94
      * Cultural Practices: Crop rotation, removal of infected plant debris, and adjusting planting time can reduce disease inoculum.94
      * Chemical Control: Seed treatment with fungicides like Metalaxyl can control downy mildews, and foliar sprays with fungicides like Mancozeb can manage leaf blights.94


Integrated Weed Management (IWM) Strategies


Weeds are a universal problem in maize cultivation, competing for resources and significantly reducing yields if not controlled during the critical early growth stages.
      * Common Weeds in India: Maize fields are infested by a diverse flora of weeds, including:
      * Grasses: Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Echinochloa colona, Cynodon dactylon.
      * Broad-leaved weeds: Trianthema portulacastrum, Amaranthus viridis, Parthenium hysterophorus.
      * Sedges: Cyperus rotundus.63
      * Integrated Weed Management (IWM): An effective IWM program combines multiple tactics:
      * Cultural Control: Practices like maintaining optimal plant density and intercropping with fast-growing legumes can help suppress weed growth.64
      * Mechanical Control: Manual hand weeding and inter-cultivation with implements like hoe weeders are effective but can be labor-intensive.63
      * Chemical Control: Herbicides are a key component of modern weed management. Pre-emergence herbicides (e.g., Atrazine, Pendimethalin) are applied shortly after sowing to control weeds as they germinate. Post-emergence herbicides (e.g., 2,4-D, Tembotrione) are used to control weeds that emerge after the crop.63 It is crucial to select herbicides based on the weed spectrum and to follow application guidelines to avoid crop injury.98


Section 5: The Indian Maize Sector: A Comprehensive Regional Analysis


India's maize sector is a dynamic and vital component of its agricultural economy. The crop's versatility allows it to be grown across diverse agro-climatic zones and in multiple seasons, supporting the livelihoods of millions. This section provides a detailed examination of the Indian maize landscape, covering production statistics, regional cultivation practices, economic viability, and the structure of its value chain.


Production Landscape: State-wise Analysis and Cropping Systems


Maize holds the position of the third most important cereal crop in India, following rice and wheat. It is cultivated on an area ranging from approximately 9.6 to 11.2 million hectares, with an annual production of 35 to 38 million metric tonnes.54 This makes India the fifth-largest maize producer in the world.99
Production is geographically concentrated, with a few states accounting for the majority of the output. The Final Advance Estimates for the 2023-24 agricultural year identify Karnataka, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana as the leading producers.102 These states leverage favorable climatic conditions, adoption of high-yielding hybrids, and established agricultural infrastructure to drive their production.

	A key feature of Indian maize cultivation is its presence across three distinct cropping seasons, a testament to its adaptability 101:
      * Kharif (Monsoon Season): This is the primary season for maize, accounting for approximately 85% of the total cultivated area.103 Sowing commences with the onset of the southwest monsoon in June-July, and the crop is harvested between September and December.105 Major Kharif-producing states include Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.103
      * Rabi (Winter Season): Sown in October-November and harvested in February-April, Rabi maize is grown in regions with assured irrigation. This season is particularly significant in eastern states like Bihar, where milder winter temperatures, clear skies, and lower pest and disease pressure often result in higher and more stable yields compared to the Kharif season.103 This trend towards Rabi cultivation represents a strategic adaptation by farmers to mitigate the risks associated with erratic monsoon patterns.
      * Zaid (Summer Season): This is a short-duration crop grown between the Rabi and Kharif seasons (March-June) in areas with sufficient irrigation facilities, often for specialty purposes like green cobs or fodder.54
The productivity of Indian maize is heavily dependent on the adoption of improved varieties. A wide array of hybrids developed by both public institutions (like ICAR) and private seed companies are available, catering to different regional needs. Public sector research has focused on developing biofortified varieties, such as the Pusa series of Quality Protein Maize (QPM) and Provitamin-A enriched hybrids, to address nutritional security.110 Private sector hybrids are often sought for their high yield potential and specific traits like drought tolerance or high starch content for industrial use.111 Despite the availability of high-yielding varieties, a significant gap often exists between their potential yield and the actual yield achieved on farmers' fields. This "yield gap" is a major challenge and is attributed to a complex interplay of factors including climate variability, soil health degradation, and the incomplete adoption of best management practices.27

The Economics of Cultivation: Cost-Benefit Analysis and Policy Support


The economic viability of maize cultivation is a critical factor for Indian farmers. The cost of cultivation includes expenses on inputs like seeds, fertilizers, and plant protection chemicals, as well as operational costs for labor, machinery, and irrigation.
In Andhra Pradesh for the 2023-24 season, the total cost of cultivation was estimated at ₹1,18,157 per hectare. Of this, variable costs (working capital) constituted about 64%, with labor being the single largest component at 36% of the total cost.103 With an average yield and market price, the net return for a tenant farmer was calculated to be ₹11,468 per hectare, with a return on investment of 1.10.103 A separate analysis for a 1-acre farm estimated a total cost of around ₹15,200, yielding a net profit of approximately ₹20,700 over a 3-4 month period, highlighting the potential for profitability under good management.114
Government policies play a significant role in the economics of maize farming. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a key policy instrument that provides a price floor for farmers, protecting them from sharp falls in market prices. For the 2024-25 marketing season, the MSP for maize was set at ₹2,225 per quintal, an increase of ₹135 over the previous year.103 While market prices have often remained below MSP in the past, recent trends show domestic prices hovering above the MSP, driven by strong demand from the feed and ethanol sectors.103
Other government schemes support maize farmers through input subsidies and infrastructure development. The Integrated Scheme on Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize (ISOPOM) provides financial assistance for the production and distribution of certified and hybrid seeds.116 The
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a national crop insurance scheme that provides financial support to farmers in the event of crop failure due to natural calamities, pests, or diseases.117 Additionally, schemes like the
Agriculture Infrastructure Fund and Pradhanmantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) aim to strengthen post-harvest infrastructure and improve irrigation access, respectively, which indirectly benefit maize cultivation.118


The Indian Maize Value Chain: From Farm to Market


The maize value chain in India is complex, involving a range of stakeholders from input suppliers to final consumers. The primary drivers of the value chain are the poultry feed and starch industries, which together consume over 60% of the domestic production.119
The value chain begins with input suppliers, including public institutions like ICAR and State Agricultural Universities, and a dominant private sector comprising national and multinational seed and agrochemical companies.108 These entities supply farmers with seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides through a network of distributors and local retailers.
Farmers (Producers) are at the core of the value chain. Production is characterized by a mix of smallholder subsistence farming and larger-scale commercial cultivation. After harvest, maize enters the marketing channel. Farmers may sell their produce to village traders, commission agents at local mandis (markets), or directly to processors and aggregators.108
Processors are the key players in value addition. This segment includes:
      * Feed Manufacturers: The poultry industry is the largest consumer of maize in India, using it as the primary energy source in feed formulations.119
      * Starch Industry: Maize is wet-milled to produce starch, which is then used in the food, textile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Further processing of starch yields value-added products like liquid glucose, dextrose, and sorbitol.120
      * Food Processors: This segment produces items for direct human consumption, such as corn flakes, popcorn, maize flour (makki ka atta), and extruded snacks.122
      * Bioethanol Producers: With the government's push for ethanol blending in petrol, the demand for maize as a feedstock for distilleries is rapidly increasing.124
The final products are then distributed through wholesalers and retailers to end consumers, which include livestock and poultry farmers, food industries, and households. The value chain faces several challenges, including fragmented landholdings, inefficient supply chains, price volatility, and inadequate post-harvest infrastructure, which can lead to losses and reduce the farmer's share of the consumer's rupee.108


Section 6: The Future of Maize: Innovations and Sustainable Pathways


The future of maize cultivation is being shaped by the dual pressures of a growing global population and the urgent realities of climate change. To meet the projected demand sustainably, the sector is turning to a powerful combination of advanced biotechnology, digital farming tools, and climate-resilient agricultural practices. These innovations promise to enhance productivity, improve resource efficiency, and build a more resilient maize ecosystem.


The Next Green Revolution: Advances in Breeding and Biotechnology


Conventional breeding has been remarkably successful in improving maize yields over the past century. However, to accelerate genetic gains and tackle complex challenges like climate resilience, breeders are increasingly integrating advanced biotechnological tools.
      * Genetically Modified (GM) Crops: Transgenic technology, which involves inserting genes from other organisms, has been used to develop maize varieties with traits like insect resistance (Bt maize) and herbicide tolerance. These traits have helped farmers manage key pests and weeds more effectively, contributing to yield stability.5
      * Genome Editing with CRISPR-Cas: The most revolutionary recent advance in breeding is the CRISPR-Cas genome editing technology. Unlike traditional GM methods, CRISPR allows for precise, targeted modifications of a plant's own DNA without necessarily introducing foreign genes.126 This powerful tool is accelerating maize improvement in several key areas:
      * Yield and Plant Architecture: By editing genes that control plant height, leaf angle, and kernel number, scientists are designing "high-density" maize varieties that can be planted closer together to increase yield per acre.126
      * Stress Tolerance: CRISPR is being used to enhance maize's natural resilience to drought, heat, and diseases by modifying the genes involved in these stress response pathways.126
      * Nutritional Quality: It enables the rapid development of biofortified maize, such as varieties with higher protein quality (QPM) or enhanced micronutrient content, by precisely editing the relevant metabolic pathways.126
      * Hybrid Development: The technology is also being used to create male sterile lines and haploid inducers, which are critical tools for streamlining and accelerating the production of elite hybrid seeds.126
These technologies, combined with genomics-assisted breeding approaches like marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic prediction, are creating a new paradigm of "intelligent maize breeding," allowing for the more rapid and precise development of superior cultivars tailored to specific environments and end-uses.130


The Digital Farm: Precision Agriculture and AI in Maize Cultivation


The digital revolution is transforming farm management, shifting from uniform field-wide applications to data-driven, site-specific interventions. Precision agriculture technologies are making maize cultivation more efficient, profitable, and environmentally sustainable.
      * Drones and Remote Sensing: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, equipped with advanced sensors are becoming invaluable tools for field monitoring.133
      * Multispectral and Hyperspectral Sensors: These sensors capture data from across the light spectrum, allowing for the early detection of crop stress from nutrient deficiencies, water scarcity, pests, or diseases, often before symptoms are visible to the human eye. This data is used to create vegetation indices like NDVI to map crop health variability across a field.134
      * Thermal Sensors: These can detect differences in plant temperature, which is a key indicator of water stress, enabling precise irrigation management.134
      * LiDAR Sensors: These provide detailed 3D maps of field topography, which are useful for planning drainage and land leveling.134
      * Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning: AI is the engine that turns the vast amounts of data collected by sensors into actionable insights.137 Machine learning algorithms can analyze drone imagery, soil data, and weather forecasts to:
      * Predict Yields: Accurately forecast yields to inform harvesting and marketing decisions.137
      * Optimize Inputs: Provide recommendations for variable-rate application of fertilizers and water, applying them only where needed and in the right amount, which reduces costs and environmental impact.139
      * Identify Pests and Diseases: AI-powered image recognition can identify specific pests or diseases, allowing for targeted and timely interventions.137
      * Support Breeding: AI can also accelerate genetic improvement by analyzing genomic and phenotypic data to predict the performance of new hybrids.137


Climate-Smart Maize Farming for a Resilient Future


Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an integrated approach that aims to achieve three interconnected goals: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes (adaptation), building resilience to climate change (resilience), and reducing greenhouse gas emissions where possible (mitigation). For maize, key CSA practices include:
      * Conservation Agriculture: This system is based on three principles:
      1. Minimal Soil Disturbance (No-Till/Reduced Tillage): Reduces soil erosion, improves water infiltration and retention, and enhances soil organic carbon.141
      2. Permanent Soil Cover: Using crop residues (mulch) or cover crops protects the soil from erosion, suppresses weeds, and conserves moisture.141
      3. Crop Rotation/Diversification: Rotating maize with legumes (like cowpea or pigeon pea) breaks pest and disease cycles and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.141
      * Improved Water Management: Adopting efficient irrigation techniques like drip or sprinkler irrigation can significantly improve water use efficiency, a critical adaptation in water-scarce regions.141 Water harvesting techniques, such as constructing farm ponds or half-moon pits, can capture and store rainwater for supplemental irrigation.141
      * Use of Climate-Resilient Varieties: A cornerstone of CSA is the deployment of maize varieties that are genetically tolerant to key climate stresses like drought and heat. The development and dissemination of these varieties are a major focus of international research centers like CIMMYT and national programs in countries like India.146
      * Integrated Nutrient Management: Optimizing fertilizer use through soil testing and site-specific application not only improves yields but also reduces the emission of nitrous oxide (N2​O), a potent greenhouse gas associated with nitrogen fertilizer application.149
The adoption of these practices has been shown to enhance the resilience of maize farmers, particularly smallholders in rainfed systems, by stabilizing yields, improving soil health, and increasing profitability in the face of increasing climate variability.143


Section 7: Synthesis and Recommendations for Stakeholders


Maize stands as a global agricultural titan, its journey from a domesticated grass to a pillar of the world food economy marked by human ingenuity and biological adaptability. Yet, its future is contingent on our ability to navigate profound challenges, from climate change and resource scarcity to market volatility and the persistent gap between potential and actual yields. The preceding analysis provides a foundation for a set of strategic recommendations tailored to the key stakeholders who will shape the future of maize.


For Farmers: Key Takeaways for Enhancing Productivity and Profitability


The farmer is the central actor in the maize value chain. Enhancing on-farm productivity and profitability requires the adoption of knowledge-intensive, integrated management practices.
      * Embrace Hybrid Technology and Site-Specific Variety Selection: The genetic potential of modern hybrids is the single most powerful tool for increasing yield. Select certified seeds of hybrids that are specifically recommended for the local agro-climatic zone and growing season (Kharif, Rabi, or summer). Prioritize varieties with documented resistance to prevalent local pests and diseases and tolerance to key stresses like drought.57
      * Adopt Integrated Nutrient Management (INM): Move beyond blanket fertilizer applications. Conduct regular soil testing to understand specific nutrient deficiencies. Combine the use of organic manures (FYM, compost) to improve long-term soil health with balanced applications of chemical fertilizers (NPK) and necessary micronutrients (especially zinc). Apply nitrogen in splits to coincide with the crop's peak demand stages, improving efficiency and reducing environmental losses.49
      * Implement Water-Conserving Practices: In both rainfed and irrigated systems, water is a critical limiting factor. In rainfed areas, adopt in-situ moisture conservation techniques like ridge and furrow planting, mulching with crop residues, and intercropping with legumes. In irrigated areas, shift towards more efficient methods like drip or sprinkler irrigation to maximize "per drop" productivity.141
      * Practice Integrated Pest, Disease, and Weed Management (IPM/IDM/IWM): Proactive and integrated management is more effective and sustainable than reactive chemical control. Regularly scout fields to detect problems early. Employ cultural practices like crop rotation and sanitation, use resistant varieties, and leverage biological controls where available. Use chemical pesticides and herbicides judiciously, based on established economic thresholds, to manage costs and minimize environmental impact.90


For Researchers: Critical Gaps and Future Research Directions


The scientific community must continue to push the boundaries of knowledge and technology to provide the next generation of solutions for maize cultivation.
      * Harness the Pangenome for Climate Resilience: The exceptional genetic diversity of maize, including its "dispensable" genes, is a largely untapped resource. Research must move beyond a single reference genome to a pangenome approach. This involves sequencing and characterizing a wide array of landraces and wild relatives to identify novel genes and alleles for tolerance to complex abiotic stresses like combined heat and drought, waterlogging, and salinity.9
      * Accelerate Breeding with New Tools: Focus on integrating advanced tools like CRISPR-Cas genome editing with genomic prediction and high-throughput phenotyping. The priority should be on editing regulatory regions of genes (promoters) to fine-tune traits like flowering time, root architecture, and nutrient use efficiency without the linkage drag associated with conventional breeding.126
      * Develop and Validate Climate-Smart Systems: Research should focus not just on individual components but on entire farming systems. This includes long-term trials to validate the synergistic benefits of combining conservation agriculture, resilient varieties, and precision nutrient management in different agro-ecologies. Quantifying the impact of these systems on yield stability, resource use efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions is critical.143
      * Bridge the Yield Gap: Conduct targeted research to understand the specific socio-economic and agronomic constraints that contribute to yield gaps in key production regions. Develop decision support tools (DSTs) that translate complex scientific knowledge into practical, location-specific recommendations for farmers.27


For Policymakers: Strategic Interventions for a Sustainable Maize Sector


Government and international bodies have a crucial role in creating an enabling environment that fosters innovation, reduces risk for farmers, and ensures the maize sector contributes to national and global food security goals.
      * Invest in Infrastructure and Market Linkages: Strengthen rural infrastructure, including irrigation, storage facilities (to reduce post-harvest losses), and roads. Promote efficient and transparent market systems, such as e-markets (e-NAM in India), to ensure farmers receive remunerative prices. Develop and support the entire value chain, from input supply to processing, to create more value and employment in rural areas.121
      * Strengthen Research, Extension, and Seed Systems: Increase public investment in agricultural research and development, particularly in breeding programs for climate-resilient and biofortified maize varieties. Revitalize agricultural extension services to ensure that new technologies and best practices effectively reach smallholder farmers. Implement policies that ensure the timely availability of high-quality, affordable certified seeds.116
      * Create Coherent and Forward-Looking Policies: Agricultural policies must be designed with a long-term perspective. This includes:
      * Incentivizing Sustainability: Promote the adoption of climate-smart agriculture through targeted subsidies, payments for ecosystem services, or support for conservation tillage equipment.
      * Balancing Competing Demands: Recognize the interconnectedness of the food, feed, and fuel sectors. Policies promoting biofuels must be carefully evaluated for their potential impact on maize prices and food security, particularly for vulnerable populations.
      * Risk Management: Strengthen crop insurance programs like India's PMFBY to provide a robust safety net for farmers against climate-related losses. Maintain strategic grain reserves to buffer against severe price shocks in the global market.117
      * Foster a Science-Based Regulatory Environment: Establish clear, predictable, and science-based regulatory pathways for new agricultural technologies, including genome-edited crops. This will encourage private sector investment and innovation while ensuring safety and building public trust.126
By working in concert, these stakeholders can harness the immense potential of maize to meet the challenges of the 21st century, ensuring it remains a vital engine of global food security, economic prosperity, and sustainable development.
